Designer description: <p>Pixelated or 8-bit version of the Wingdings font. Created mainly as a font for Wing Ding Gaster from Undertale. This character set varies slightly from the one used in Undertale to fit my own visual preference. Only alphanumeric and regular punctuation characters are included.</p>
